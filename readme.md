# Express & MongoDB tutorial

# What is this
- This is the starter code for a very basic mongoDB and express backend. As long as you have node and mongodb installed correctly on your machine, this repository should work
- You can watch the video of this being created on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9tF6TM_Fiw

# Instructions
- Ensure you have Node.js installed. This is a very simple task.
- Ensure you have mongoDB installed and running as a service on your computer. This is also relatively simple.
- So long as you have the two requirements above installed, you should be able to clone this repo and have a running backend server.
- Once you clone this repository to your machine, you are going to want to run the `npm i` command at the root of the repository, this will install all the node packages you are going to need
- To start the server you can type the `npm run watch command`
